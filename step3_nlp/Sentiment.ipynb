       "  xxmaj although i 'm not too big a fan of romance , the romantic scenes and themes are not at all overpowering . xxmaj they also have the rare ability to come off as sweet instead of cheesy . xxmaj that says a lot from a girl who routinely falls asleep during chick flicks . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj then , of course , is the classic xxup mi element of humor . xxup cmi is quite adept at delivering deadpan lines , altogether absurdist humor , and simply good fun . xxmaj gary xxmaj coleman makes a cameo as a budding young entrepreneur , and world events are discreetly xxunk at without stepping out of the bounds of the game . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj its not entirely fair to compare xxup cmi to xxup mi and xxup xxunk because it truly is in a realm of its own . xxmaj personally i can never find a favorite between the 3 as they all are quite different from each other . xxmaj however , if you want a swashbuckling good time with the flair of the classic series , i insist you give this game a shot . xxmaj you will xxup not be disappointed . \n",

       "  xxmaj this film made me think , and left me in the end with a quiet smile on my face . xxmaj its about character development and relationships , truth and lies , and whether love is sometimes simply not enough . xxmaj some very nicely understated acting from all the participants , especially the two leads , xxmaj tom xxmaj wilkinson and xxmaj emily xxmaj watson . \n",

       " \n",
       "  \" xxmaj le xxmaj samourai \" is still his best work , mainly because it has more character development than this , but on a technical level they 're probably equal . xxmaj besides , while \" xxmaj le xxmaj samourai \" had one great lead performance , this has four . xxmaj alain xxmaj delon is once again an ultra - cool gangster on the prowl - this man 's silence is fascinating . xxmaj bourvil is superb as the police inspector on the case of the heist and escaped con . xxmaj he steals every scene he is in , and proves that he was a skilled dramatic actor ( in xxmaj france he is best known as a slapstick comedian in the mode of xxmaj buster xxmaj keaton ) . xxmaj yves xxmaj montand is great also as the shaky and paranoid gun expert . xxmaj gian xxmaj maria xxmaj volontè ( a regular in spaghetti westerns ) is overshadowed by his three co - stars but still does an adequate job . \n",

       "  xxmaj once again , xxmaj melville 's direction is superb . xxmaj taking equal influence from both xxmaj american crime thrillers and the xxmaj french new wave , the man always seems to know the best shots and angles to choose . xxmaj this is more slowly - paced than most caper flicks , but it really pays off by the end . \" xxmaj le xxmaj cercle xxmaj rouge \" is a bit short of being an absolute classic , but is still one of the best heist flicks ever made . xxmaj tarantino must 've seen this before making \" xxmaj reservoir xxmaj dogs \" .
